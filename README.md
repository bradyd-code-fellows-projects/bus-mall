CodeFellows Code 201 "BusMall" Catalog Project

A client wants to create a bus version of SkyMall catalog named BusMall. This project helps the client with market research by creating an app where users are presented with pictures of two different products side-by-side. Users choose between the two products which one they like better and click on it.  The choices are tallied up and the data help the BusMall creators decide which products to have in their catalog.
